## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ menu.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ 404.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ projects/
|           â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put any Astro components.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
