            Engineered their Rewards Program with another intern. Originally 
            meant to be a small POC that was supposed to occupy us the entire 
            internship duration, we completed the project in 3 weeks. This small
            intern POC got upgraded to one of Pomelo's most important projects.
            By the end of the internship, the Rewards Program was working in full
            capacity for a subset of users.
